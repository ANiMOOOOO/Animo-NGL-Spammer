 This is a multithreaded *NGL.LINK spammer!* it can be used to annoy anyone who has ever done a ngl.link and has the app installed on their phone! It has numerous quality features to enhance the trolling and make it fun to use.

 # Ngl.link is oftenly posted by 14-16 yo kids with no life to talk to some people or is used a place to confess anonymously. What if we spammed it? This script is a fast demonstration on how simply we can send in a flood by just a simple script Made by Animo??
